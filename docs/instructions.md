# Instructions for a DIY Accessible Spinner
To make the accessible spinner, we sourced parts from our local hardware store and some online stores. With access to some common makerspace tools and our instructions, we hope you will enjoy creating this toy! Feel free to modify and make improvements as well. We've included rationale for each material choice in case you're curious about whether a particular part can be exchanged or modified.
# Materials
## Box and Wheel
Material | Purchasing | Rationale | 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
4 foot by 8 foot sheet of half inch rigid foam insulation | About $15 at your local home improvement store. | We use this foam because it is lightweight and durable. Should a student throw the spinner, hopefully the spinner will not be damaged, nor will a person who is hit by the spinner when it is thrown be hurt.
