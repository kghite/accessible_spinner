# Spinner Design Process
The accessible spinner was created for a course called Technology, Accessibility, Design taught by Caitrin Lynch and Paul Ruvolo at Olin College of Engineering in Spring 2018. This half-semester project was done by a team of three senior students: Kathryn Hite (Engineering with Software Systems Major), Miriam Kome (Engineering with Human Centered Design Major) and Matthew Ruehle (Engineering with Computing Major) in collaboration with our community partner at Perkins School for the Blind, HuyenTran Vo (Coordinator at the Grousbeck Center for Students and Technology). 

## Context
Many games and lessons use spinners or wheels, for example wheel of fortune and probability lessons. Right now teachers usually project a spinner on the board and games have flat plastic spinners. Unfortunately, these spinners are only visually accessible, and so arenâ€™t meaningful or accessible to students who are blind or visually impaired. The flat spinners have other accessibility problems too, for example for students with limited mobility and dexterity. The result of these inaccessible spinners is that already-marginalized students tend to end up confused and excluded from the class activity.

## Principles
We identified several important principles that our design must satisfy:
* Universally accessible and legible
* Considerate of identities and contexts
* DIY make and repair accessible
* Adaptable and customizeable
* Facilitates learning and play
* Safe, durable, and reliable

## Design Decisions
We made many important design decisions based on the principles we identified, our research, and our conversations with our community partner. These decisions are crucial to the spinner's effectiveness in making spinner-based lessons and games accessible to all students. In this section are our accessibility and legibility design decisions.

### Accessibility
Students of all abilities should be able to spin the spinner, and enjoy it as it spins. 
* Any switch which connects using a mono-jack plug can be used to spin the spinner.
* An upright handle in the middle of the spinner can be used by students with various amounts of manual dexterity.
* The spinner plays clicks as sections spin by and music when it stops.
* The spinner vibrates as sections spin by.
### Legibility
Students of all abilities should be able to read and enjoy the overlay of the spinner.
* Bright, high-contrast colors on the overlay, particularly black, yellow, and red, which are good for students with CVI or low vision. Gray and neutral colors everywhere else to reduce visual clutter.
* Dimensional Paint (puffy paint) to raise any marks on the overlay such as boundaries between sections.
* Use braille, raised characters, and bold writing (all three!) for all labels.

## Future Work
We made a first version of the spinner in the short time we had, and we hope others will recreate and improve upon our design. Some potential improvements we have already identified are: 
* Develop a consistent overlay format or style guide so that students always know where to find the information they want.
* Determine via user research how long the spinner should wait before allowing another spin after the button has been pressed. 
* Add a dial that changes the speed/strength of the spinner as appropriate for different uses and users.
* Refine the electrical system and increase robustness. We can throw the spinner across the room without damage to the electronics, but there are still some bugs in our prototype.
