# Spinner Design Process
The accessible spinner was created for a course called Technology, Accessibility, Design taught by Caitrin Lynch and Paul Ruvolo at Olin College of Engineering in Spring 2018. This half-semester project was done by a team of three senior students: Kathryn Hite (Engineering with Software Systems Major), Miriam Kome (Engineering with Human Centered Design Major) and Matthew Ruehle (Engineering with Computing Major).
