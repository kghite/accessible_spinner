# Spinner Design Process
The accessible spinner was created for a course called Technology, Accessibility, Design taught by Caitrin Lynch and Paul Ruvolo at Olin College of Engineering in Spring 2018. This half-semester project was done by a team of three senior students: Kathryn Hite (Engineering with Software Systems Major), Miriam Kome (Engineering with Human Centered Design Major) and Matthew Ruehle (Engineering with Computing Major). 

Documentation of our process is currently housed in google drive, and is coming soon to this site.
