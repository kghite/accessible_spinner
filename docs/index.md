# Accessible Spinner Project
Welcome to the documentation website for the Accessible Spinner Project. This project began with three students in the class Technology, Accessibility, Design at Olin College of Engineering, in partnership with Huyentran Vo at the Perkins School for the Blind. We designed a spinner for use in games and activities which is accessible to students who are blind or visually impaired and/or have other physical or cognitive impairments, as well as anyone who does not belong to these groups. A spinner is a circle with pie-slice sections, each of which represents a choice (much like the faces of a die). The spinner is spun, then as it comes to rest a pointer indicates which section is chosen. Our spinner can be spun by hand or using your favorite accessibility switch. It provides audio, haptic, tactile, and visual feedback. It can be taken apart, cleaned, repaired, and customized with different overlays for different games and activities.

The intent of this project was to create an initial prototype that can be easily copied or further developed to fit the needs of specific student groups or classrooms.  The following sections detail all of the information that you need to understand how we created our spinner and how you can create your own.

## Design Process
Lots of research went into the human-centered design of our accessible spinner. If you're interested in knowing more, [click here to read more about our design process](process.md). 

## DIY Spinner Instructions
We did our best to document our project and make material choices such that others can recreate and improve upon our design. [Click here to find instructions and resources to make your own spinner](instructions.md).
