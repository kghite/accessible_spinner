# Spinner Overlays
The spinner is designed to be used with lots of different games and lessons, and to be customized for any student's needs and interests. Overlays, which are attached by velcro to the wheel, can be made from common classroom materials such as foam core posterboard, markers, and puffy paint. Below are some overlay ideas to get you started. The possibilities are endless and we hope you have fun creating new games!

Keep in mind that overlays should be legible to everyone who wants to play. For example, we labeled each segment with bold, high-contrast, raised writing, with braille, and with another indicator when appropriate.

## Sensory Overlays
* Draw shapes or a spiral on the overlay with puffy paint to feel and watch as it spins. 
* Cover the overlay with felt and use velcro to attach toys, streamers, etc.
* For students with some sight and dexterity, put a dry-erase sticker on the overlay and draw spirals with a high-contrast marker while it's pinning.

## Brainy Games and Lesson Games
### Emotions and Storytelling
* Label each segment with an emotion. When it lands on an emotion, tell a story about feeling that way. 
* Label each segment with a conjunction (and, but, or, if, so). Start a story, then spin for a conjunction to keep the story going and going and going.
### Adapt Boardgames
* Divide the overlay into 6 slices and label with numbers to replace dice in a boardgame or colors for a game like Candyland.
* Label the overlay segments with dollar amounts for games like Wheel of Fortune.
### Math Games
* Label each section with a math question and use the spinner like flashcards. 
* Label each section with an operation (plus, minus, multiply, divide) or with a mix of operations and numbers to make random math questions.
### Classroom Tools
* Label each section with a name to make a random name picker. 
* Label each section with an activity to do when a student finishes their work.
* Label each section with a coping strategy for students who are upset, such as taking a walk, coloring, drinking water, taking slow breaths, etc. 

## Active Games
Label each segment of the spinner with an exercise or dance move, and use the spinner for exercise games.
