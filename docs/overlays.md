# Spinner Overlays
The spinner is designed to be used with lots of different games and lessons, and to be customized for any student's needs and interests. Overlays, which are attached by velcro to the wheel, can be made from common classroom materials such as foam core posterboard, markers, and puffy paint. Below are some overlay ideas to get you started. The possibilities are endless and we hope you have fun creating new games!

Keep in mind that overlays should be legible to everyone who wants to play. For example, we labeled each segment with bold, high-contrast, raised writing, with braille, and another indicator where appropriate.
